- For this lab we will need to open the web browser and type in portal.azure.com
- You would need to create a subscription and that'll give $200 worth of Azure credits in which you'll have 30 days to use 
- In order to create a virtual machine, you would first need to create a resource group
- You have the choice of selecting the resource group icon or typing it in the search bar

- Next you will fill out the information below, create a name for the resource group, then select the region you're in.
- Once information is filled out, Select "Review + Create"
- After it'll state validation has passed in green, and now you can click "Create" at the bottom, and now you have a resource group.

- Next you will select Microsoft Azure located at top left hand corner to bring you back to the home screen
- Now we can begin to create our virtual machine
- You have the option to either select the VM icon or type in the search bar
- Once selected, click on the plus sign next to "Create" then select the first option, "Azure Virtual Machine"
- We will fill out the information like we did for the resource group
- You will also select the resource group that already exists and that is where the virtual machine will be stored
- Create a name for the VM, select the region, then for image select your operating system, under size select the virtual cpu you'd like to use
- Next create a username and password and check the box to confirm licensing
- Lastly you'd select "Review + Create".
- Once completed it'll say validation passed in the green at the top of the screen. Bear in mind, this may take a few minutes to complete.
